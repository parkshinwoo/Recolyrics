Pretty women are you here Are you here right now huh
We should all disappear right now
Look youre gettin all your friends and youre gettin in the car
And youre comin to the house are we clear right now huh
You see the fleet of all the new things
Cop cars with the loose change all white like I move things
Niggas see me rollin and their mood change
Like a motherfucker
New flow I got a dozen of em
I dont trust you you are undercover
I could probably make some step sisters fuck each other
Whoop Talkin filets with the truffle butter
Fresh sheets and towels man she gotta love it
Yeah they all get what they desire from it
What tell them niggas we aint hidin from it
Yo thinkin out loud
I must have about a milli on me right now
And I aint talkin about that Little Wayne record
Im still the highest sellin female rapper for the record
Man this a million single sold
I aint gotta compete with a single soul
Im good with the ballpoint game finger roll
Ask me how to do it I dont tell a single soul
Pretty women wassup Is you here right now
You a stand up or is you in your chair right now
Uhh do you hear me
I cant let a wack nigga get near me
I might kiss the baddest bitch if you dare me
I aint never need a man to take care of me
Yo Im in that big boy bitches cant rent this
I floss everyday but I aint a dentist
Your whole style and approach I invented
And I aint takin that back cause I meant it
Uh thinkin out loud
I could be broke and keep a million dollar smile
LOL to the bank checkin my account
Bank teller flirtin after checkin my account
Pretty ladies are you here
Truffle butter on your pussy
Cuddle buddies on the low
You aint gotta tell your friend that I eat it in the morning
Cause she gonna say I know
Can I hit it in the bathroom Put your hands on the toilet
Ill put one leg on the tub
Girl this my new dance move I just dont know what to call it
But bitch you dancing with the stars
I aint nothin like your last dude whats his name Not important
I bought some cocaine you can snort it
She became a vacuum put it on my dick like carpet
Suck the white off like chocolate
Im so heartless thoughtless lawless and flawless
Smallest regardless largest in charge
And born in New Orleans get killed for Jordans
Skateboard Im gnarly Drake Tunechi and Barbie
You know
Yo I had to reinvent I put the V in vent
I put the heat in vents man I been competin since
I look beyond what people sayin and I see intent
Then I just sit back and decipher what they really meant
Cherish these nights cherish these people
Life is a movie but there will never be a sequel
And Im good with that as long as Im peaceful
As long as years from now Im taking my daughter to preschool
Cherish these days man do they go quick
Just yesterday I swear it was o six
Ten years ago thats when you proposed
I look down yes I suppose
All things go all things go
All things go all things go
I feel a minute yeah we got it then its gone
While we keep waiting for a moment till it falls
So cant nobody ever tell me that Im wrong
Cause Im a ride Im with you still the night is young
We keep goin we go we go we go
We wake back up and do it all again
We know we know say fuck the world we ridin til the end
I know its sudden look at what weve become
I just want you to know that I did it for you
I lost my little cousin to a senseless act of violence
His sister said he wanted to stay with me but I didnt invite him
Why didnt he ask or am I just buggin
Cause since I got fame they dont act the same
Even though they know that I love him
Family ties broken before me niggas tryna kill him he aint even call me
And thats the reflection of me yes I get it I get it it was all me
I pop a pill and remember the look in his eyes the last day he saw me
All things go all things go
All things go all things go
I feel a minute yeah we got it then its gone
While we keep waiting for a moment till it falls
So cant nobody ever tell me that Im wrong
Cause Im a ride Im with you still the night is young
We keep goin we go we go we go
We wake back up and do it all again
We know we know say fuck the world we ridin til the end
I know its sudden look at what weve become
I just want you to know that I did it for you
Let me make this clear Im not difficult Im just about my business
Im not into fake industry parties and fake agendas
Rock with people for how they make me feel not what they give me
Even the ones that hurt me the most I still show forgiveness
I love my mother more than life itself and thats a fact
Id give it all if somehow I could just rekindle that
She never understands why Im so overprotective
The more I work the more I feel like somehow theyre neglected
I want Caiah to go to college just to say We did it
My child with Aaron wouldve been sixteen any minute
So in some ways I feel like Caiah is the both of them
Its like hes Caiahs little angel looking over him
And I know Jelani will always love me and Ill always love him
And Im just his little sister not Nicki Minaj when Im around him
Yeah we did it lets leave this imprint
Just finished writing this is the Pinkprint
All things go all things go
All things go all things go

Gotta protect me you gotta sweat me
You said you thought you was ready and I said lets see
But I aint mean that I need some fucking proof
Cause what happens if I fall in love then you cut me loose
You just a heart breaker wont let you break mine
Cause Ill be smashing windows and cutting them break lines

Cause who knew if I should let myself go with you
Who knows who knows so I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart ooh
To keep you from breaking my heart ooh
Even though I said fuck you I lied I lied
I thought eventually you would let me go
That was my insecurities and my ego
Missed my jump shot missed my free throw
Miss the way we kiss miss the d o
Man it was good while it lasted
That shit wasnt real it was magic
If it was a record it would have been classic
But fuck you though orgasmic
This is what I gotta do to keep me from falling
Stalling the truth who knew what youd
Do If I let you in
My mama aint raised no fool
I am not your usual typical type
Who would protect me if I never hide
Falling so fast I am afraid of you
So I lied I lied I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart ooh
To keep you from breaking my heart ooh
I lied ooh baby oooh
Cause what if I let myself go with you
to moonnpence from papayeverte
Here we go again its the game we love
Sheets all over the floor and they laced with drugs
You aint play your cards right you had the Ace of Clubs
Hit you with the Ace of Spade in your face and shrugged
Blood drippin out your arm on my Asian rugs
We was just planning a wedding caught cagin doves
You was just tellin your mans that you hate the clubs
Now we in the crying game heart laced with slugs
Are you alone Do you need someone
Is it too late to talk Did I wait too long
Thousand words dont change a thing

The crying game
Welcome to the crying game where you lose your soul
Where it aint no easy cash you got to use the toll
Aint no cruise control you bout to lose control
Aint no smilin faces here we slammin doors and dishes
Sayin we dont miss each other but its all fictitious
Sayin that we had enough but enough of what
Another slap to the face another uppercut
Im just abusive by nature not cause I hate ya
Not cause I wanna guess I wanna imitate ya
I know its hard I know I intimidate ya
But is you stayin or goin
I couldnt breathe and you aint even know it
How come you never show it
All this love you speak of
All I want is to love and to be loved
To love and to be loved
Im losin a thing I thought Id win
And Im coming undone

Do you ever think of me when you lie
Lie down in your bed your bed of lies
And I knew better than to look in your eyes
They only pretend you will be mine
And you know how you made me believe
You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie
Lie down in your bed your bed of lies
You could never make eye contact
Everything you got was based off of my contacts
You a fraud but Imma remain icon stat
Balenciagas on my boots with the python strap
You was caught up in the rush and you was caught up in the thrill of it
You was with me way before I hit a quarter mil in it
Put you in the crib and you aint never pay a bill in it
I was killin it man you got me poppin pills in it
I told Baby hit you I said this nigga buggin
Cause I was doing it for us I told em fuck the public
Couldnt believe that I was home alone contemplating
Overdosin no more coastin no more toastin over oceans
They say you dont know what you got til its gone
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
But there was something that I shouldve asked all along
Imma ask on the song
Do you ever think of me when you lie
Lie down in your bed your bed of lies
And I knew better than to look in your eyes
They only pretend you will be mine
And you know how you made me believe
You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie
Lie down in your bed your bed of lies
I just figured if you saw me if you looked in my eyes
Youd remember our connection and be freed from the lies
I just figured I was something that you couldnt replace
But there was just a blank stare and I couldnt relate
I just couldnt understand and I couldnt defend
What we had what we shared and I couldnt pretend
When the tears roll down its like you aint even notice em
If you had a heart I was hoping you wouldve showed it some
What the fuck you really telling me what you telling me
I could tell you lying get the fuck out dont yell at me
I aint mean to cut you I aint wanna catch a felony
This aint How To Be A Player you aint Bill Bellamy
They say you dont know what you got til its gone
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
But there was something that I shouldve asked all along
Imma ask on the song
So does she know Ive been in that bed before
A thousand count and not a single threaded truth
If I was just another girl
Then Im ashamed to say that Im not over you
Theres one thing I need to know
So call me when youre not so busy just thinking of yourself
Do you ever think of me when you lie
Lie down in your bed your bed of lies
And I knew better than to look in your eyes
They only pretend you will be mine
And you know how you made me believe
You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie
Lie down in your bed your bed of lies

I used to think that wed run away
Whenever pretty summer day
I remember when you would say
Would be OK come what may
I never knew you would lie to me
Took everything from inside of me
Your silhouette in the doorway
But before you walk away
Just say goodbye look in my eyes
So that I always will remember
Frozen in time always be mine
Baby boy youll be young forever
Ill be over here youll be over there
Ima shed a tear but I really dont care
Frozen in time always be mine
Baby boy youll be young forever
I used to think that wed reunite
Id be your wife in the real life
I thought that youd come back for me
And you would take me away
I never knew only as a teen
Youd reappear only in my dream
Your silhouette in the doorway
But before you walk away
Just say goodbye look in my eyes
So that I always will remember
Frozen in time always be mine
Baby boy youll be young forever
Ill be over here youll be over there
Ima shed a tear but I really dont care
Frozen in time always be mine
Baby boy youll be young forever
This is my last cry
Is this the only way
This is my own prison
Im frozen in time in time in time
Dont say goodbye look in my eyes
So that I always will remember
Frozen in time always be mine
Baby boy youll be young forever
Ill be over here youll be over there
Ima shed a tear but I really dont care
Frozen in time always be mine
Baby boy youll be young forever
Youll always be mine frozen in time
Young forever young forever
You shoulda left the other day
You let me beg for you to stay
This is a sickening joke
that you play with my emotions
And so I pray you burn in hell and
you never find the ocean
I hope your fire fire burns baby
I hope your fire fire burns baby
I hope you lay down in your sleep and
you choke on every lie you told
And when youre reaching out for me
youll see you reap everything you sowe
You piece of shit you broke me down
Thought you said you would hold me down
But I can see it in your eyes
that your blinded by the flashing lights
And yous a stupid muthaf
cker for letting this thing pass you by
I hope your fire fire burns baby
I hope your fire fire burns baby
I hope you lay down in your sleep and
you choke on every lie you told
And when youre reaching out for me
youll see you reap everything you sowe
Burn burn

I came to win to fight to conquer to thrive
I came to win to survive to prosper to rise
To fly
To fly
I wish today it will rain all day
Maybe that will kinda make the pain go away
Trying to forgive you for abandoning me
Praying but I think Im still an angel away
Angel away yeah strange in a way
Maybe that is why I chase strangers away
They got their guns out aiming at me
But I become Neo when theyre aiming at me
Me me me against them
Me against enemies me against friends
Somehow they both seem to become one
A sea full of sharks and they all smell blood
They start coming and I start rising
Must be surprising Im just summising
I win thrive soar higher higher higher
More fire
I came to win to fight to conquer to thrive
I came to win to survive to prosper to rise
To fly
To fly
Everybody wanna try to box me in
Suffocating every time it locks me in
Paint their own pictures then they crop me in
But I will remain where the top begins
Cause I am not a word I am not a line
I am not a girl that can ever be defined
I am not fly I am levitation
I represent an entire generation
I hear the criticism loud and clear
That is how I know that the time is near
So we become alive in a time of fear
And I aint got no motherfucking time to spare
Cry my eyes out for days upon days
Such a heavy burden placed upon me
But when you go hard your nays become yays
Yankee Stadium with Jays and Kanyes
I came to win to fight to conquer to thrive
I came to win to survive to prosper to rise
To fly
To fly
Get ready for it
Get ready for it
Get ready for it
I came to win
Get ready for it
Get ready for it
Get ready for it
I came to win
I came to win to fight to conquer to thrive
I came to win to survive to prosper to rise
To fly
To fly

With fake tits and a bad dye job

So finally I broke down and bought her an iPod
And caught her stealin my music so I tied her arms and legs to the bed
Set up the camera and pissed twice on her
Look two pees and a tripod

You got your fans waitin tell me you aint feet under
And tell me that you coming back that you just to a break
Maybe I blamed you for everything that was my mistake
In hindsight I loved your rawness and I loved your edge
Cuz it was you who talked me down from jumpin off the ledge
Your earings bamboo your long nails too
Your BMW everytime you came through
